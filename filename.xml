<p align="left">Not really looking as I crank the engine and start downhill  for town, I tilt my head out my window in a rush of wind to take in winter  stars and sweep away the fumes from a petty argument at home.  My escape  velocity: not fast enough, but faster than I should be going.</p>
<p align="left">Right away I pass a pickup and a jeep parked oddly on the road.  My  headlights wash over a car upturned in a field and people trotting towards it.</p>
<p align="left">I pull over on stiff grass.<br>
          In a wavering of flashlights: no dents or shattered glass. But hurrying through  mashed down weeds and settling dust, I see the car bottom up, naked in the  glare of strangers and the Milky Way, a flipped turtle, legs flailing.  In  the passenger seat a woman hangs upside-down.</br></p>
<p align="left">She pounds the dash with a fist and wails at the dumbstruck sky, What have you  DONE to me?<br>
          Shes unbuckled, lowered, and pulled out, crying.  Then a man crawls from  the drivers side, his left hand bleeding, his right holding a bottle sloshing  with something clear, vodka or gin.  He stands and slings it into the  dark.  A far off thump.</br></p>
<p align="left">You tried to KILL me! she yells from where shes sitting now, a jacket heaped  over her, then a childs comforter.</p>
<p align="left">Hot metal ticks.</p>
<p align="left">I smell dripping gasoline and duck fast to check the back seat.  IS THERE  ANYONE ELSE? I call out.</p>
<p align="left">NO, she calls back.  But  wheres my shoe?  Im COLD.</p>
<p align="left">The stunned man is suddenly mumbling at my side, Gotta get that shoe . . . .   Then lurching towards the car he tries to light a cigarette.</p>
<p align="left">HEY DONT! I shout and dive away, rolling.</p>
<p align="left">In my minds eye: WOOF!  A pillow of orange heat blowing him back.</p>
<p align="left">Soon enough he staggers up and starts to wander in a circle.  That shoe .  . . .</p>
<p align="left">We stand around and watch.  I think about an eyebrow I might no longer  quite feel, the womans face shining wet in flickering firelight.</p>
<p align="left">Finally, sirens in the distance.</p>
<p align="left">From just uphill I hear our two  dachshunds, bodies tensed at the backyard fence,<br>
            snouts lifted straight up, sky howling, as they tend to with coyotes and every  ambulance that sprints out from town.  I imagine my wife coming out to  stand beside them, then looking down at all the lights and thinking, OH JESUS  ITS HIM.</br></p>
<p align="left">So I take my leave.  Driving home, I tilt my head into cool night air and  wonder if that upturned woman, as she hung briefly in the dark, noticed how  much space there is between the stars and how quietly they burn.</p>
